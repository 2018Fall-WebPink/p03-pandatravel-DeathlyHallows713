<h1>Haunted Alcatraz Prison</h1>

<p>Alcatraz is the most well-known prison in America, and there's a good reason why. It's a massive abandoned prison isolated on an island of its own with no means of escape. It held some of the most infamous criminals to have ever lived, such as Al Capone and Machine-Gun Kelly. Most prisoners who went through Alcatraz's gate either left their sanity behind in the penitentiary or never left at all. Some say the spirits of the prisoners still haunt the place to this very day.
